					<p>This Introduction was published in the Swiss newspapers in December, 1917, with an episode of the novel and a note explaining the original title, <i>L’Un contre Tous</i>. “This somewhat ironical name was suggested⁠—with a difference⁠—by La Boëtie’s <i>Le Contr’ Un</i>; but it must not be supposed that the author entertained the extravagant idea of setting one man in opposition to all others; he only wishes to summon the personal conscience to the most urgent conflict of our time, the struggle against the herd-spirit.” <a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Simon and I then understood our hatred of strangers and barbarians, and our egotism, in which we included ourselves and our entire small moral family.⁠—<i>The first care of him who would wish to live must be to surround himself with high walls; but even in his closed garden he must introduce only those who are guided by the same feelings, and interests analogous to his own</i>.” “A Free Man.”</p>
					<p>In three lines, three times, this “free man” expresses the idea of “shutting-up,” “closing,” and “surrounding with walls.” <a href="part-5.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
